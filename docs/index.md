# Telekom Design Tokens

## Introduction

### What are design tokens?

### Who uses design tokens?

### Why should you use design tokens?

### How are design tokens related to Scale, the telekom design system?

## Light and dark mode
Design tokens are the base for an intuitive light and dark mode.
You can read more about why you should implement it and how to do so in this section:

- [Light and dark mode](./light-and-dark-mode.md)

## Working with telekom design tokens
The `@telekom/design-tokens` repo contains the `core` tokens and the `semantics` tokens. You can find them within the `src` folder.
As a user of [Scale](https://github.com/telekom/scale) or the the design tokens repo you only need to care about the `semantic` tokens.
