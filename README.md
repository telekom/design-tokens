Telekom Design Tokens is the source of truth for designing Telekom-branded digital products. By default, it's built to align with our corporate brand and design but allows for customization to fit your particular product.

# Customizing Telekom Design Tokens for open source software

Although the source code for Telekom Design Tokens is free and available under the MPL 2.0 License, Deutsche Telekom fully reserves all rights to the Telekom brand. To prevent users from getting confused about the source of a digital product or experience, there are strict restrictions on using the Telekom brand and design, even when built into code that we provide. For any customization other than explicitly for the Telekom, you must replace the Deutsche Telekom default theme.

To use Telekom Design Tokens as open source software and customize it with a neutral theme, please follow the instructions for our [open source version](#open-source-version).

## Open source version

By following the instructions for the open source version, you obtain source code/packages that use a neutral theme and are fully covered by the MPL-2.0 License.

### Using the source code directly

If you want to use the source code, remove the following folders. These folders contain all the protected brand and design assets of the Telekom and are not available under the MPL-2.0 License:

| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| src/telekom                                | Telekom tokens             |
